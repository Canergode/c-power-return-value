# C Power Function (Return-by-Value)

This repository demonstrates the fundamental concept of returning values from functions in C.

## Overview
The program calculates the power of a given base to an exponent. The function `calculate_power` computes the value and returns the result directly to the caller. This is the most common and readable way to handle simple calculations in C.

## Technical Details
- **Language:** C
- **Logic:** Iterative multiplication using a for-loop.
- **Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the exponent.
